## Usage

### Facade: TLog

This package provides a facade named `TLog` for logging messages. You can use this facade to log messages to different channels dynamically.

Example:

```bash
use twid\logger\Facades\TLog;

// Log an information message to the 'default' channel
TLog::info('This is an information message');

// Log an error message to the 'error' channel
TLog::error('This is an error message', ['error_code' => 500]);
```

If you use a channel name as a method, the facade will log the message to that channel. If the method is not explicitly defined, it is treated as a channel name, and the log method is invoked on the corresponding logger instance.

### Logger

The `Logger` class is responsible for handling log messages. It's initialized with a log channel, and you can use it to log messages with specific data.

Example:

```bash
use twid\logger\Logger;

// Create a logger instance for the 'info' channel
$logger = new Logger('info');

// Log a message with additional data
$logger->log('This is a log message', ['user_id' => 123]);
```
